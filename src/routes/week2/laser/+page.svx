The main project of Week 2 was to design a parametric construction kit â€“ mine was of a Ferris Wheel. Literally everything went wrong so here's the story of that.

#### Cadding with Fusion360

For this project I wanted to:
- Use a variety of joints
- Make living hinges
- Have all measurements be parametric
- Assemble everything in Fusion to check joint lengths and if there would be collisions

Fusion has a cool parameters feautre where you can specify <i>User parameters</i> that can be used across the model

I saw a cool Fusion360 render of a <a href="https://fab.cba.mit.edu/classes/863.20/CBA/people/codypaige/Projects/Week01/week01.html">past HTMAA student's</a> living hinges and wanted to try do something similiar. First mistake.

Living hinges require bending in Fusion but folding out when exporting to DXF, this made Sheet Metal the ideal material to use. Unfortunally, sheet metal is **weird**. When I tried calculating the lengths of pieces so they'd bend flush against each other I couldn't get them to fit. Eventually I had to accept that there's such thing as the **Fusion Constant**, it's equal to 0.299 mm the exact size of the gap that wouldn't go away.

In the end it looked quite realistic and having the ability to unfold it came in very handy while laser cutting.

After the base was made I sketched out the other parts, assembling each together (with the align command) to make sure everything fitted. At the beginning everything was parameterized however as I added more sketches which interacted with previous sketches the contraints started interfering with each other. I think I should of componitorized more of my bodies and I made the mistake of having all the sides of the base be in the same sketch.

Firstly I made the supporting beams. They use snap joints which fit under the top of the base.

Afterwards I made two parts with press-fit joints which act the supporting beam for the two supports

Next up was the actual wheel. This component was completeley parameterized and the stokes were circular pattern so the amount of carts and their height off the ground etc can be easily changed.

Since the two wheels have to move together they needed to be joined, so a made with press-fit joints support bars

Finally I made the cart and attached them to the wheel with another support

#### Laser cutting the parts

To actually laser cut the parts I needed to account for kerf. Thankfully there is a Fusion360 plugin, [DXF For Laser](https://apps.autodesk.com/FUSION/en/Detail/Index?id=7634902334100976871&os=Win64&appLang=en), which can create **.dxf** files from your bodies faces and offsets the dimensions to account for kerf.

I exported all my bodies as .dxf files, made some test cuts, and then cut all of them out.

Once cut I got to the fun of actually assembling and testing my living hinges

Some of the joints were a bit tricky and needed to be malleted in, Unfortunally it was late so some pieces were broken during this process.

Finally it was all assembled!
