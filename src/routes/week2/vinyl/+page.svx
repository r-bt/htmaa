Our first task was the make something with Vinyl. I've some experience with Stillouete (ðŸ˜±) and Cricut Vinyl machines which are for hobbyists so I was curious as to the differences with a professional machine.
 
Previously I had a Vinyl sticker of Bait (a creature from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Dragon_Prince">The Dragon Prince</a>) on my laptop, however I designed this really poorly and even people who knew the show couldn't tell who the character was. I decided to replace it with another Dragon Prince character â€“ Zym.

This photo is in colour so firstly I imported it into Adobe Illustrator and image traced it. The result wasn't perfect so I played around with the threshold value until the right areas where in black for the vinyl cutter

Next up was a giant game of USBs, USB adaptors, email, and finally WeTransfer to get the file onto the EDS computer. There I imported it into MOTs and began cutting. Once the cut was complete I had some Vinyl which looked suspiciously like Zym

With a handy dandy tweezers I spent the next half and hour weeding out vinyl, recutting when I messed up (ðŸ˜¢) and finally getting all the unneeded vinyl off. Since it was going onto my laptop I then put transfer paper over the sticker.

Finally, I removed my old Bait sticker and put the new Zym sticker on
